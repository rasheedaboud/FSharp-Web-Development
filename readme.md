# Multipart F# Web Development

Hey everyone, I was recently trying to help a friend learn how to use F# and [Fable](https://fable.io/) and [Feliz](https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/Feliz/)  to build client side SPA applications.

I thought maybe this would be useful to someone else as well? 

Anyway this repo contain a multipart series on how to get up and running with the aforementioned libraries.
