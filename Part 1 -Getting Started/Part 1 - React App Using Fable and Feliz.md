## TL;DR: 

This post introduces how to set up and use F# with the Feliz library for web development, specifically for creating React applications. It covers installing the Feliz project template, updating packages to support JSX components, and demonstrates building type-safe HTML and client-side routing in F#. The author also shows how to integrate JSX components into an F# app, providing a way to use third-party JavaScript libraries more easily within an F# project. The post aims to highlight the productivity and type safety benefits of using F# in web development.

## Background

Hello everyone! As a seasoned F# user, I've decided to pay it forward to the incredible community that has supported me throughout my programming journey. I was recently working helping a colleague learn F# and web development, and he suggested that it my be useful to to take our sessions and throw them into the ether and maybe help other get up and running. 

For this purpose Ive made a series of repositories that walk you through getting started, we then move on to explore topics that empower you to build rich and robust user interfaces.

The end goal being to show you just how straightforward it can be to use F# in the browser allowing you to leverage its amazing capabilities to boost your productivity when building apps for the web.

In this initial installment of the series, we'll dive into setting up Feliz - my library of choiceâ€”for building apps with Fable. Plus, I'll give you a sneak peek at another way to craft React components using Fable's new JSX component feature.

Really quick lets introduce the technology we will be using:

### F#

F# is a mature, open-source, cross-platform functional-first programming language developed by Microsoft as part of the .NET language family. It is designed to be succinct, expressive, and efficient, enabling developers to write concise and correct code quickly. Although it emphasizes functional programming paradigms, it is also a fully-fledged object-oriented language and supports imperative programming styles.

Key features of F# include:

- **Type Inference**: F# infers types during compilation which means you often don't need to explicitly declare them.
- **Immutability**: By default, values in F# are immutable, which leads to safer and more predictable code.
- **Pattern Matching**: A powerful feature that allows complex control flow based on the shape of data.
- **Conciseness**: The syntax is terse, reducing boilerplate and making code easier to read and write.
- **First-Class Functions**: Functions are treated as first-class citizens allowing for advanced functional programming techniques.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Built-in support for async workflows makes concurrent operations straightforward.
- **Units of Measure**: Type-safe arithmetic on quantities with units.

### Feliz

Feliz is an innovative DSL (Domain Specific Language) for building React user interfaces using F#. It provides a set of APIs that are designed to make writing React components in F# more enjoyable and idiomatic. Feliz aims to leverage the powerful type system of F# to provide compile-time guarantees about your UI code.

Features of Feliz include:

- **Type-Safe Builders**: Create HTML elements and attributes with type safety ensuring you don't make common mistakes like misspelling an attribute name or passing an incorrect value type.
- **Hooks API**: Use React hooks such as `useState` or `useEffect` directly within your components in a natural way.
- **Elmish Integration**: For those who prefer the Elm architecture, Feliz can be used alongside Elmish for state management within Fable applications.

### Fable

Fable is an F# to JavaScript compiler powered by Babel, designed to produce readable and standard JavaScript code from your F#. It allows you to write your application logic in F#, which then gets transpiled into JavaScript that can run in any modern browser or Node.js environment.

Key aspects of Fable include:

- **Interop with JavaScript**: Call JavaScript functions and use existing libraries directly from your F# code.
- **Source Maps Support**: Debug your application directly in F# thanks to source maps that map the compiled JavaScript back to your original code.
- **Modern JS Features**: Take advantage of modern JavaScript features like modules, async/await, destructuring assignments, etc., while writing in a strongly-typed functional language.
- **Community Ecosystem**: Benefit from a rich set of community-driven tools and libraries specifically tailored for use with Fable.

Together these three technologies allow developers familiar with .NET and interested in web development to build applications using their existing knowledge while taking advantage of the robustness offered by functional programming principles. With this stack, you can create complex client-side applications that run smoothly on the web.


## Prerequisites

- .Net 8 | .Net 7
- Node ^18
- a package manager (npm,pnpm,yarn etc.), 
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Ionide](http://ionide.io/)
- [Highlight templates in F#](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alfonsogarciacaro.vscode-template-fsharp-highlight)

## Getting Started

First things first we will install the Feliz project template. A guide can be found on the [Feliz Site](https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/Feliz/#/Feliz/ProjectTemplate).

```console
dotnet new -i Feliz.Template
```

If you already have Feliz template installed now is good time to update it

```console
dotnet new -u Feliz.Template
dotnet new -i Feliz.Template
```

next we can create and run the app

```console
dotnet new feliz -n AwesomeApp
cd AwesomeApp
pnpm i
pnpm run start
```

That it! THats how easy it is to spin up a new react app with F# and Feliz. If you open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173/` you should be greeted with your shiny new awesome Feliz App. 

Let's quickly step through the code to get familiar with the landscape.

### Main

In the ```Main.fs``` we are mounting our react app. This should look very similar to anyone familiar with react. Using Fable we get a reference to 'feliz-app' element from ```index.html``` and we call `root.render (Components.Counter())`  to mount our app.

```fsharp
module Main

open Feliz
open App
open Browser.Dom

let root = ReactDOM.createRoot (document.getElementById "feliz-app")
root.render (Components.Counter())
```

### Type Safe Html

In the ```Components.fs``` we have some example of how to build UI using Feliz. You don't have to use a class with static members, you can define your react components using functions and decorating them `[<ReactComponent>]`. However using an F# class to group components with similar features or use cases can be useful to group similar components.

You should notice right away there is no Html in our **Counter** component! We are instead using the Feliz DSL to write type safe F# code which is transpiled to Html.

For example the `Html.div []` is an F# function which takes a list (denoted by the `[]`) of props or other react components and renders them out inside a `div`.

Were also using some local state to store the value of a count:

```fsharp
let (count, setCount) = React.useState (0)
```

and button to update the state:

```fsharp
Html.button [ 
  prop.onClick (fun _ -> setCount (count + 1)); 
  prop.text "Increment" ]
```

Thanks to the F# compiler we get immediate feedback if we wrote our Html wrong or supplied and incorrect attribute or property. This compile time safety is a **HUGE** productivity boost for me personally.

I cant tell you how many times I fat finger some Html and don't realize it until someone reported it as a bug.

### Routing

The **Router** component gives you an example of how we can perform client side routing in Feliz. There are other options available however this is a very elegant solution.

My favorite part is that since this is F# we get  exhaustive pattern matching on our routes, reducing or eliminating chances that user hit a route we did not anticipate.

We also get all the F# type safety goodness in our routes and component functions!

```fsharp
[<ReactComponent>]
static member Router() =
  let (currentUrl, updateUrl) = React.useState (Router.currentUrl ())

  React.router [ 
	router.onUrlChanged updateUrl 
	router.children [ 
		match currentUrl with
		| [] -> Html.h1 "Index"
		| [ "hello" ] -> Components.HelloWorld()
		| [ "counter" ] -> Components.Counter()
		| otherwise -> Html.h1 "Not found" ] ]
```

Basically we take the current url and parse it to return an F# list that we can then pattern match over. In this case we are storing the current url in local state and passing the function ```updateUrl``` to the router component.


### Update Packages 

Now that we have the basic app up and running lets add support for JSX components. The addition of using F# templated string to render JSX components was added in `Fable 4.0.0-theta-011` ish. Prior to this every third party component you wanted to use had to be wrapped in F# types first. Which definitely slowed down your productivity. 


First things first let change the project target to .Net 8. Future you may not need to complete these step once Feliz library get updated to the latest bits.

Next we will bump out .Net version target from .Net 7 to .Net 8.

```diff
 ./AwesomeApp.fsproj
<PropertyGroup>
+ <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
- <TargetFramework>net7.0</TargetFramework>
</PropertyGroup>
```

Next lets update the **fable** and **femto** dotnet tools.

```console
dotnet tool update fable
dotnet tool update femto
```

We will also need to update all nuget packages. A very powerful tool for package management a tool called [Fake](https://fake.build/) which I highly recommend you look. For now lets just use the cli.

```console
cd ./src
dotnet add package Feliz
dotnet add package Feliz.Router
dotnet add package Fable.Core
```

Next lets add reference to the Feliz compiler plugin. I'm going to use femto to do this. If you're not familiar with femto tool you can check it out [here](https://github.com/Zaid-Ajaj/Femto). This too is amazing, it will install any required nuget or npm packages automagcally.

```console
femto
femto inspall FSharp.Core
femto install Feliz.CompilerPlugins
```

We will have to modify our **package.json** to instruct fable to output .jsx files, also we will need to update our **index.html** to use the Main.jsx instead of Man.fs.js.

In our **package.json**

```diff
{
 "private": true,
 "scripts": {
-   "start": "dotnet tool restore && dotnet fable watch src --runFast vite",
+   "start": "dotnet tool restore && dotnet fable watch src -e .jsx --runFast vite",
 "build": "dotnet tool restore && dotnet fable src --run vite build",
 "clean": "dotnet fable clean src --yes"
 },

...
```

And in our **index.html**;

```diff
<!doctype  html>

<html>
 
 <head>
  <title>Feliz App</title>
  <meta  http-equiv='Content-Type'  content='text/html; charset=utf-8'>
  <meta  name="viewport"  content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <link  rel="shortcut icon"  type="image/png"  href="./img/favicon-32x32.png"  sizes="32x32"  />
  <link  rel="shortcut icon"  type="image/png"  href="./img/favicon-16x16.png"  sizes="16x16"  />
 </head>
 <body>
  <div  id="feliz-app"></div>
-     <script  type="module"  src="./Main.fs.js"></script>
+     <script  type="module"  src="./Main.jsx"></script>
 </body>

</html>
```

At this point you'll probably want to update your .gitignore to ignore all the generated .jsx files. I also like to add the **fable_modules** to .gitignore.



```git
src/*.jsx
fable_modules
```

## JSX Components

Now that we have all that nonsense out of the way we can add .jsx components and use them from Feliz.

Here is a very contrived example of how to do that.

```fsharp
open  Fable.Core
open  Fable.React

[<AutoOpen>]
module  JsxHelpers  =
  let inline  toJsx  (el:  ReactElement)  :  JSX.Element  =  unbox  el
  let inline  toReact  (el:  JSX.Element)  :  ReactElement  =  unbox  el
 
type  Components  =
  [<ReactComponent>]
  static member  JsxCount(props:{|count:int|})  =
    let  (count,  setCount)  =  React.useState  (0)

    JSX.jsx
      $"""
        <div  style={{{{marginTop:'10px'}}}}  >From JSX: {props.count}</div>
      """ 
	|>  toReact
```

We add a couple helper functions to convert back and forth from **ReactElement**  and  **JSX.Element** types.

Then we can use this new JsxCounter inside the existing Counter component:

```fsharp
[<ReactComponent>]
static member  Counter()  =
  let  (count,  setCount)  =  React.useState  (0)
  Html.div [   
	Html.h1  count
    Html.button  [  
	  prop.onClick  (fun _ ->  setCount  (count  +  1));  
	  prop.text  "Increment"  ]
    //Add our new JSX component.
    Components.JsxCounter({|  count  =  count  |})  ]
```

Lets run the app again and navigate to /counter.

```console
cd ..
pnpm start
```

You should get an output that matches the following. Not very pretty but it does illustrate how easy it is to use the JSX feature.

![jsx counter in F#!!!](https://rasheedaboudblogstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blogs/jsxcounter.gif?sp=r&st=2024-01-05T04:17:47Z&se=2050-01-05T12:17:47Z&spr=https&sv=2022-11-02&sr=b&sig=%2FoSyOlsIIgI0Vx04av643TXF3pqzivicMPbx1cjtn%2Bk%3D)

Thanks to the VS code extension we added earlier we also get code completions right inside our templated string. You can also pass props from F# to the JSX component and add styles. However as you probably noticed escaping your ```{}``` can get a little crazy, however I feel this is a small price to pay.

## Wrapping Up

Hopefully this showed you how simple it is to get started with [Fable](https://fable.io/) and [Feliz](https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/Feliz/#/). These tools are my goto anytime I'm making a new react app. I find using F# in the browser to incredibly productive, also the type safety that the F# language provides  me with an added safety net that even Typescript cant compete with.

In this blog post, we covered how to get started with F# and the Feliz library for building web applications. We walked through setting up a Feliz project template, mounting a React app, and using the Feliz DSL to create type-safe HTML. We also explored client-side routing and how to add JSX support to Feliz.

Using F# and Feliz provides many benefits, including type safety, increased productivity, and the ability to leverage the power of React in a functional programming language. With Feliz, we can write type-safe HTML using the Feliz DSL and take advantage of JSX components.

On a side note you may be asking who do we want to jump through all those hoops just to add another way to represent Html in our App (JSX)?  Especially in a manner where we loose all our type safety? Well Alfonso Garcia has an excellent series of blog post about just that!  You can check them out over [here](https://fable.io/blog/2022/2022-10-12-react-jsx.html).

The answer is we didn't  **have** too. However if you want to use any third party JavaScript packages, you will need to wrap them in F# types. Similar to adding Typescript annotations to a JavaScript library. Personally I've found the JSX method to be the most productive way to quickly wrap a component and us it from F#.

In part 2 we will look at using environment variables on the client and slowly work our way up to a decent sized production app. 
Overall, F# and Feliz are a powerful combination for building web applications, and I hope this blog post has given you a good starting point for exploring these tools further. Happy coding!
